Start_Alarm Test 1:
This test will demonstrate how different threads were created for alarms with different times.  Alarm 1 which has
Time = 10 is added to Display Thread 4, while Alarm 2 which has Time = 15 is added to Display Thread 5.

Start_Alarm Test 2:
This test will demonstrate how alarms with the same time are added to the same thread.  Both Alarms 1 and 2 are added to
Display Thread 4 because they both have the same Time = 10.

Cancel_Alarm Test:
This test demonstrates how cancelling an alarm will stop printing it.  Furthermore, if all of the alarms in a thread
(alarms that all share the same Time value) are cancelled, the thread will exit.

Change_Alarm Test 1:
This test will demonstrate how changing the message of an alarm will cause the thread to start printing the new message.

Change_Alarm Test 2:
This test will demonstrate how changing the time of an alarm will cause a different thread to start printing it.  Display
Thread 4 has all the alarms with Time = 15 and Display Thread 5 has all the alarms with Time = 20.  When Alarm 1 is
changed to have its Time set to 20, it is removed from Display Thread 4, and added to Display Thread 5.
